Web Design

The first phase of designing the website was to come to an agreement amongst our development team. As I already had some imaginary thoughts how our project would look like, is simple and clean-  nevertheless user friendly. For the ideas we used brands like 'Polestar', 'Starbucks' and 'DJI'. 

Now on to the assigning tasks for the individuals, as I, perhaps most of us have little to no knowledge before attending to this course. We started off making prototypes of the index.html and further enhancing the layout on this basis.

Communication of choice, our tool of choice was discord. The work ethics among us was high, the results came out pretty neat. Although we missed one of our development team, unfortunately.

The layout structure could be better planned ahead if each one of us knew what to do, as most of the issues we stumble  into was trial and error. In general it was straight forward and deep dive, as more and more issues appear when one is fixed another appears. Stackoverflow can be handy at times but definitely not user friendly, as sometimes you get stuck for hours and you really don't know how to formulate your question and writing a constructive post. 

We kept it minimal as we could, there were just too many handy tools, but due to lack of experience we did not create this project based on Bootstrap. Frankly speaking, the structure and learning curve is not the ideal we could imagine, like many helpful codes are built on base of the fundamentals, we are assigned to complete something yet we are not standing on solid ground. As majority of the time you want a quick fix, whilst digging for you answer, the answers you get is as long as the rabbit hole goes.
